      <p>I love instant ramen. If this computer was instant ramen I would eat it. If my phone was an instant ramen I would have no choice but to eat it. I also like strawberry milk.</p>

      <p>"Linsanity "Linsanity is a 2013 American documentary film about the rise of Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin. The film was directed by Evan Jackson Leong."</p>
      <p>Linsanity was a really good documentery. It was very inspiring, and Jeremy Lin is a great basketball player. I watched this doc for a camp program and everyone agreed that this was one of the better movies we had to watch. It was very good. You should watch it.</p>

      <p>I read To Kill a Mockingbird for 8th grade english. It is considered a classic for literature and is a book. It is about Scout. The name Scout is arguably a pretty cool one. I'm pretty sure thats not her real name but that's chill. Still a cool nickname. Atticus is also a pretty cool name. </p>
